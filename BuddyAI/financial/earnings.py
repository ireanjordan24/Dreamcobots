# BuddyAI Earnings Distributor
# Implements the 50/50 earnings split between Buddy and its clients.
#
# Distribution rules:
#   - Autonomous mode: Buddy keeps 50 %, client receives 50 %.
#   - Compute-share mode: client receives 50 % of profits from their
#     computer usage while Buddy (operator) retains the other 50 %.
