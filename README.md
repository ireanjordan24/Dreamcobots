# DreamCobots Repository

Welcome to **DreamCobots** — a versatile, user-friendly platform for automation and income generation. This repository contains a growing collection of collaborative bots (cobots) designed to automate tasks, generate income, and empower users across multiple industries.

> **Contributors:** All bots must follow the **GLOBAL AI SOURCES FLOW** mandatory architecture.
> See [CONTRIBUTING.md](CONTRIBUTING.md) for full guidelines.

## GLOBAL AI SOURCES FLOW — Mandatory Architecture

Every DreamCo bot must implement the eight-stage pipeline defined in
`framework/global_ai_sources_flow.py`:

```
GLOBAL AI SOURCES → Data Ingestion → Learning Classifier → Sandbox Test Lab
  → Performance Analytics → Hybrid Evolution Engine → Deployment Engine
  → Profit & Market Intelligence → Governance + Security
```

See [`framework/global_ai_sources_flow.py`](framework/global_ai_sources_flow.py)
and [`CONTRIBUTING.md`](CONTRIBUTING.md) for the full specification and
contribution requirements.

To check that all bots in the repository comply with the framework, run:

```bash
python tools/check_bot_framework.py
```

---

## 🔧 Repo Validation & Build Tools

### Validate required files

Prevent missing-file CI failures by running the validator locally before pushing:

```bash
python scripts/validate_repo_files.py
```

The validator reads [`repo-required-files.yml`](repo-required-files.yml) and prints any missing paths with a clear action message.  It is also wired into the `DreamCo Main — Run & Validate` CI workflow as an early step.

### Detect missing files in CI logs (BuildFixBot)

```bash
# Parse a saved CI log file
python bots/build_fix_bot/build_fix_bot.py --log path/to/ci.log

# Pipe directly from stdout
cat ci.log | python bots/build_fix_bot/build_fix_bot.py

# JSON output (for scripting)
python bots/build_fix_bot/build_fix_bot.py --log ci.log --json
```

---
## GitHub Pages Instructions
1. Navigate to **Settings > Pages**.
2. Select the `deployment-setup` branch and root directory as the publishing source.
3. Save your settings to host the frontend.
