"""
Eligibility Engine for the 211 Resource and Eligibility Checker Bot.

Calculates whether a household qualifies for common assistance programs
(SNAP, Medicaid, CHIP, WIC, RentAssistance) based on Federal Poverty
Level (FPL) thresholds defined in config.py.

No personally-identifiable information is stored here; the engine only
receives ephemeral income/household values from the session.
