## Usage

```python
from bots.real_estate_bot.real_estate_bot import RealEstateBot
from tiers import Tier

bot = RealEstateBot(tier=Tier.PRO)

# --- Classic deal-finding ---
deals = bot.search_deals("austin", budget=400000)
evaluation = bot.evaluate_property("1204 Oak Blvd, Austin TX")
roi = bot.estimate_roi(deals[0])
trends = bot.get_market_trends("phoenix")

# --- Housing + Gov Contract System ---
# 1. Find cheap distressed properties
distressed = bot.find_distressed_properties(state="MI", max_price=20000)

# 2. Find government housing programs
programs = bot.find_gov_housing_programs(category="emergency_housing")

# 3. Calculate revenue
revenue = bot.calculate_housing_revenue(beds=5, program_id="GHP001")
# → $3,400/month net on a 5-bedroom with HUD Emergency Vouchers

# 4. Match a specific property to the best program
match = bot.match_property_to_program("DP001")

# 5. Generate outreach messages
outreach = bot.send_outreach(
    "housing_department",
    address="312 Elmwood St, Milwaukee WI",
    program_name="HUD Emergency Voucher",
    unit_count=3,
    beds=3,
)
```

## Revenue Model Example

```
5-bedroom distressed property (acquired for $18,500)
→ Matched to HUD Emergency Housing Voucher ($850/person/month)
→ 5 tenants × $850 = $4,250/month gross
→ $3,400/month net (after 20% operating costs)
→ Payback in ~5.4 months
```
