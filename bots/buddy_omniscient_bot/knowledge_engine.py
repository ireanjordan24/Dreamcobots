Knowledge Engine — Omniscient AI Knowledge Base for Buddy Omniscient Bot.

Buddy is designed to surpass all other AI models in breadth, depth, and
real-time applicability of knowledge. This engine powers:

  • Comprehensive knowledge domains spanning every field of human endeavor.
  • Direct comparison of Buddy's capabilities against major AI competitors,
    demonstrating Buddy's superiority across all dimensions.
  • Real-time knowledge retrieval across domains — from quantum physics to
    pop culture, car repair to space exploration.
  • Knowledge gap detection and proactive learning suggestions.
  • Multi-modal guidance: text, AR overlays, video, and voice.

Adheres to the Dreamcobots GLOBAL AI SOURCES FLOW framework.
